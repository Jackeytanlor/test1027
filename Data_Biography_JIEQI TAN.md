### 1. Who collected the data?

The data is collected by urban researchers. Inside Airbnb, the source of the data shows that the data is divided into separate categories by city, and the data is derived from each listing information as identifying information.

### 2. Why did they collect it?

Airbnb is an innovative platform for sharing economy. Airbnb could impact the development of relevant urban policies and tourism[1]. Therefore, short-term rental data in Airbnb reflects the socio-economic level and tourism development of cities. Urban researchers can analyse urban development from many perspectives like technology level, sociology, and economics through the data analysis of Airbnb, a popular short-term rental platform.

### 3. How was it collected?

The original information was collected from the Airbnb platform and displayed on Airbnb. Inside Airbnb’s founder, Murray Cox uses a “copied and pasted” approach to crawl listings in many cities using a variety of technologies such as python code from GitHub.

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

Airbnb data contain some key data like type of listings, address, the score of reviews, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price and geographical coordinates. Consequently, this dataset can be summarized into three types of data: host information, tenant information and reviews, and listing information. In the further spatial study of Airbnb data, the room type, price, and occupancy characteristics of the listing information can allow urban researchers to deeply analyse spatial patterns[2]. The ratings of the various categories of listing in the renter reviews can allow economic researchers to study business potential assessment of Airbnb.

### 5. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

The data catalogue is detailed and the overall type of data contains data on the Airbnb platform about hosts, tenants and listings. However, the accuracy of the data collection process is questionable[3]. For example, by analysing the data, the price column has gaps and very low or high values, which can cause errors in the data in the subsequent socio-economic analysis[2]. On the other hand, the update of listings in the data is problematic. Inactive Airbnb listings can be found in the database by observing the host date and frequency of review. Failure to filter out inactive listings can produce an overestimation of the number of listings and mislead the results of subsequent analyses.

According to the previous research, many researchers use IA datasets for academic research. The dataset lacks the exact content interpretation of the data. Researchers can make errors related to the interpretation of short data sets. Besides, in terms of data structure, the data lacked specific time information, and when it comes to resident reviews and listing status, it did not allow researchers to analyse recent status, disturbing the timeliness of the results. In terms of socio-economic analysis, the lack of data such as the size of the listing may prevent the researcher from having a more accurate classification of the house[4].

### 6. What kinds of analysis would this support?

#### Urban socio-economic analysis 
Airbnb widely influences the rental and real estate market[2]. Through the location data and listings information from Airbnb, the Urban socio-economic system can be evaluated through statistical analysis such as correlation analysis of regions. Moreover, according to relevant studies, through statistical analysis of Airbnb spatial pattern and KDE analysis urban, some research found that there is a correlation with the distance to the centre of Metropolitan.
#### Industry business analysis 
There is an aggregation effect in the rental market and this effect could be both positive and negative[5]. According to some research. the relationship between the aggregation effect in the market can be assessed by analysing the clustering of listings and the prices from the Airbnb data. These kinds of methods can form a relevant predictive analysis of the future business market.
#### Tourism analysis
Airbnb is an important platform for travellers to find accommodation for travel purposes beyond the choice of branded hotels by combining it with other travel facility data. Airbnb data can be used to analyse travellers’ travel preferences for destinations [12]. The mapping of the city can subsequently contribute to the improvement of the urban transportation system and tourism facilities.

### 7. Which of the uses presented in Q.6 are _ethical_?

Data analysis should be carried out purposefully without compromising the information of stakeholders from the dataset[6]. Many data can relate to personal rights [7]. While analysing Airbnb data, the location of the data, the privacy of the data and management of the data are all important issues. The information of listings, hosts and tenants in the data are all related to individual rights[8], so when we do some analysis the uses of these kinds of data can easily infringe on individual privacy.

When it comes to urban socio-economic research, researchers are mostly urban researchers. Much research requires the use of data on the location of properties and their corresponding price data. The location data needs to be called upon in an informed manner. The Airbnb data is already transparent enough in the data collection process that the uses of this data are ethical.

In the process of business analysis research, the research population is mostly business analysts, who need to ensure proper regulation of the data and protection of the privacy of the user community when working with Airbnb data. Personal data and location information of hosts are important to note in the market analysis process. Avoid preference analysis of individual occupational and behavioural data to obtain excessive results.

In the process of tourism analysis, the crowd is mostly strategic analysts. If they research in-depth study of user experience or travel preferences of tourists, the process of access to tenant information and flow research may cause trouble to the tenant's right to know autonomy. The analysis of the state of the analysis should be from the listings for the analysis of data objects, in the business analysis should be more from the listings evaluation to start. In the case of tourism analysis, this should be used in conjunction with the relationship between the property and the associated public facilities to ensure ethical use.
